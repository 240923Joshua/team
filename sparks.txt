The multi-stage fitness test (MSFT), also known as the beep test, bleep test, PACER test (progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run), or the 20m shuttle run test, is a running test used to estimate an athlete's aerobic capacity (VO2 max).
The test requires participants to run 2010 meters back and forth across a marked track keeping time with beeps 200. Every minute or so, the next level commences: the time between beeps gets shorter; participants must run faster. If a participant fails to reach the relevant marker in time, they are cautioned. A second caution ends the test for that runner. The number of shuttles completed is recorded as the score of that runner. The score is recorded in Level.Shuttles format (e.g. 9.5). The maximum laps on the PACERÂ© test is 247,[1] which former Central Middle School student Dennis Mejia achieved,[2] the only person to ever reach such a level.
